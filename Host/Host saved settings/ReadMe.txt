3DHex folder contains all the necessary files in order the host to run!

    If 3DHex was installed by the compiled setup then this 
folder has already installed to "C:\Users\user\AppData\Local"
    else if you want to play around with the source code 
then you have to manually transfer that folder to the above location
because the host will search for those files there
