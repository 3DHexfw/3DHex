3DHex is an open source 3D printer firmware. The Host uses the CPU power of any typical desktop computer to solve really complex mathematical equations and generates a binary file. This file then is transfered either via USB or SD Card to the MCU. The MCU sets its outputs according to the raw 0s and 1s that binary file contains and controls the printing process.
