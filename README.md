3DHex is an open source 3D printer firmware. The Host uses the CPU power of any typical desktop computer and generates a binary file. This file then is transfered either via USB or SD Card to the MCU. The MCU sets its outputs according to the raw 0s and 1s that binary file contains. 

## Features of version 1.0.0

- User friendly configuration
- Jerk free S-Curve velocity profile
- Either S-Curve or Trapezoid profile
- Real arc G02/G03 motion 
- Jump velocity 
- Basic thermal protection
- Working with RAMPS board
- USB printing (15KHz step rate)
- SD Card printing (25KHz step rate)
- LCD 16x2 support
- Only for Cartesian 3D printers

## Installation

All compiled current and previous versions of the firmware are located at  [Releases](https://github.com/3DHexfw/3DHex/releases). The setup will also create a folder on the desktop which contains the MCU code in order to upload to the board.

## How to print
